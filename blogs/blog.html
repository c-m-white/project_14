        <h2>8.4.23</h2>
        <p>So far in this course, I have learned basic html. I have also started learning the concepts of css, whether it is inline, internal, or external. We have been encouraged to save all of our work, and that has been a valuable resource for me to look back and find examples. I have also been able to research on my own how to do some things, as the course I am currently taking cannot cover every detail. Although I don't enjoy being confused with a difficult task ahead of me, I really enjoy the satisfaction that comes when I have finally figured something out and it just "clicks". I really appreciate that the Zoom classes are recoreded, so I can go back and watch them at my own pace as I pause them and do my own research. The knowledge is coming in slowly, but surely.</p><br>

        <h2>8.18.23</h2>
        <p>I am climbing the hill perhaps a bit more slowly than I had originally anticipated.  I am loving learning about CSS, but the whole concept of Bootstrap and SCSS is still difficult for me to comprehend.  I am trying to implement elements that I have learned into the design of this webpage.  </p>

        <p>I am finally learning Javascript!  We will see how this goes! Some days, I am still so confused, then something clicks and I can see the pieces fit together.</p>

        <h2>10.6.23</h2>
        <p>I seem to be going through phases where I <i>think </i> I know what I am doing, then... <i>Poof!</i> it's gone!  Then I claw my way out of the hole of confusion that I have found myself in, and I think it will be OK once again. You can look at it like this... the more I learn, the more I am sinking into a dark abyss... kind of like what this blog page is doing.  Each entry is further and further down, toward the bottom of dark blue nothingness.  Haha!  </p>

          <h2>10.13.23</h2>
          <p>So far I keep having problems with clashing code.  Specifically, CSS and javascript.  For example, on two of the html pages where I have javascript, I have to give them their own javascript page because when I try to combine them, it goes all wonky.  The same goes for the CSS.  I got it to look the way I want, but I am struggling with cleaning and simplifying the behind-the-scenes stuff.</p><br><br></div>

          <h2>10.21.23</h2>
        <p>Holy cow!  These last few weeks have been a plethora of information overload for me!  We have touched on the concept of jQuery, which I have implimented in a silly little quiz on my project page.  Sometimes, I feel like giving up, but I have come this far.  I am so close to the finish-line for this course I am taking, but in reality, this is just the beginning.  I will have to go back and review everything I have learned.  Working overnight in a warehouse (40 plus hours a week), in addition to taking this software development course, not to mention all of my "mom" and "wife" responsibilities, has really taken its toll.  Whew!
