            <h2>Introduction...</h2> 
            <section>
                <p> Whoever said that you can't teach an old dog new tricks has got it wrong! I am currrently 44 years old, and I am learning software development for the first time in my life. I am excited to take this journey. You can think of this website as if it were a blank slate. As I navigate through my software development class, the information I am absorbing is being painted onto that blank slate. This website will reflect evertything that I am learning in this course. My learning and growth will be documented here. </p>

                <p> As mentioned above, this website will document my adventures in what I learn about software development. Specifically, I have been learning about web design with html. Currently, I work overnight in an Amazon warehouse. While I really do enjoy my job, I do not want to be doing that for the rest of my life. With a little bit of encouragement from my family, I have decided to take a class that will help broaden my horizons and give me further opportunities in the future.</p><br />
            <p> I have even opened a <a class="highlight" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carrie-white-306b6429/">LinkedIn</a> profile for the first time. I am excited to gain experience and to build up my portfolio. This website is a great place to start!Even though there is currently nothing in my LinkedIn profile, I do acknowledge that everyone has to start somewhere. This is my beginning!</p>

            <h2>Mini Bio...</h2>  
            <section>
              <p>I am a 44 year old mother of four.  In the 24 years that I have been married, I have devoted most of that time at home, raising my children.  A few years ago, I decided to venture out into the workplace and landed a job at an Amazon Sort Center.  I worked for about six months at <a class="highlight" href="https://www.mapquest.com/us/oregon/amazon-fulfillment-center-pdx5-410858465"> PDX5 </a>, just outside of Portland, Oregon, before moving to Phoenix, AZ. After settling in with my family, I once again found employment with Amazon, this time at <a class="highlight" href="https://www.mapquest.com/us/arizona/gyr2-fulfillment-center-459181060">GYR2</a>.
              <p>Outside of working at Amazon (which I do enjoy), I love playing the piano, cheering my kids on in marching band, and playing with my dogs.  I also enjoy reading, hiking, sleeping, and sipping on a good cup of coffee.  I am excited to be learning about software development through <a class="highlight" href ="https://www.correlation-one.com/">Correlation One</a>, offered by<a class="highlight" href="https://www.amazoncareerchoice.com/home">Amazon's Career Choice</a> program.</p>
